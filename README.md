# Python-week-4
This Python program reads content from a user-specified file, modifies it by converting all text to uppercase, and writes the modified content to a new file. It prompts the user for both the input and output filenames, making it easy to work with any text file.

The program also includes error handling to manage situations like missing files or permission issues, displaying clear messages to guide the user. If the input file does not exist or cannot be read, the program informs the user and prevents crashes, making file operations safe and user-friendly.
